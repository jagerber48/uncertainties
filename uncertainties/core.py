def wrap(f, derivatives_args=[], derivatives_kwargs={}):
    """
    Wraps a function f into a function that also accepts numbers with
    uncertainties (UFloat objects); the wrapped function returns the
    value of f with the correct uncertainty and correlations. The
    wrapped function is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement
    for the original function: they can be called in the exact same
    way, the only difference being that numbers with uncertainties can
    be given to the wrapped function where f accepts float arguments.

    Doing so may be necessary when function f cannot be expressed
    analytically (with uncertainties-compatible operators and
    functions like +, *, umath.sin(), etc.).

    f must return a float-like (i.e. a float, an int, etc., not a
    list, etc.), unless when called with no number with
    uncertainty. This is because the wrapped function generally
    returns numbers with uncertainties: they represent a probability
    distribution over the real numbers.

    If the wrapped function is called with no argument that has an
    uncertainty, the value of f is returned.

    Parameters: the derivatives_* parameters can be used for defining
    some of the partial derivatives of f. All the (non-None)
    derivatives must have the same signature as f.

    derivatives_args --

        Iterable that, when iterated over, returns either derivatives
        (functions) or None. derivatives_args can in particular be a
        simple sequence (list or tuple) that gives the derivatives of
        the first positional parameters of f.

        Each function must be the partial derivative of f with respect
        to the corresponding positional parameters.  These functions
        take the same arguments as f.

        The positional parameters of a function are usually
        positional-or-keyword parameters like in the call func(a,
        b=None). However, they also include var-positional parameters
        given through the func(a, b, *args) *args syntax. In the last
        example, derivatives_args can be an iterable that returns the
        derivative with respect to a, b and then to each optional
        argument in args.

        A value of None (instead of a function) obtained when
        iterating over derivatives_args is automatically replaced by
        the relevant numerical derivative. This derivative is not used
        if the corresponding argument is not a number with
        uncertainty. A None value can therefore be used for non-scalar
        arguments of f (like string arguments).

        If the derivatives_args iterable yields fewer derivatives than
        needed, wrap() automatically sets the remaining unspecified
        derivatives to None (i.e. to the automatic numerical
        calculation of derivatives).

        An indefinite number of derivatives can be specified by having
        derivatives_args be an infinite iterator; this can for
        instance be used for specifying the derivatives of functions
        with a undefined number of argument (like sum(), whose partial
        derivatives all return 1).

    derivatives_kwargs --

        Dictionary that maps keyword parameters to their derivatives,
        or None (as in derivatives_args).

        Keyword parameters are defined as being those of kwargs when f
        has a signature of the form f(..., **kwargs). In Python 3,
        these keyword parameters also include keyword-only parameters.

        Non-mapped keyword parameters are replaced automatically by
        None: the wrapped function will use, if necessary, numerical
        differentiation for these parameters (as with
        derivatives_args).

        Note that this dictionary only maps keyword *parameters* from
        the *signature* of f. The way the wrapped function is called
        is immaterial: for example, if f has signature f(a, b=None),
        then derivatives_kwargs should be the empty dictionary, even
        if the wrapped f can be called a wrapped_f(a=123, b=42).

    Example (for illustration purposes only, as
    uncertainties.umath.sin() runs faster than the examples that
    follow): wrap(math.sin) is a sine function that can be applied to
    numbers with uncertainties.  Its derivative will be calculated
    numerically.  wrap(math.sin, [None]) would have produced the same
    result.  wrap(math.sin, [math.cos]) is the same function, but with
    an analytically defined derivative.

    Numerically calculated derivatives are meaningless when the
    function is not differentiable (e.g., math.hypot(x, y) in (x, y) =
    (0, 0), and sqrt(x) in x = 0). The corresponding uncertainties are
    either meaningless (case of hypot) or raise an exception when
    calculated (case of sqrt). In such cases, it is recommended (but
    not mandatory) to supply instead a derivative function that
    returns NaN where the function is not differentiable. This
    function can still numerically calculate the derivative where
    defined, for instance by using the
    uncertainties.core.partial_derivative() function.

    The correctness of the supplied analytical derivatives an be
    tested by setting them to None instead and comparing the
    analytical and the numerical differentiation results.

    Note on efficiency: the wrapped function assumes that f cannot
    accept numbers with uncertainties as arguments. If f actually does
    handle some arguments even when they have an uncertainty, the
    wrapped function ignores this fact, which might lead to a
    performance hit: wrapping a function that actually accepts numbers
    with uncertainty is likely to make it slower.
